TO DO
-   Make result row show green, yellows and reds
    * We need to pass the state of squares to view on rendering
    * We are having this problem
        - Because we are rendering all rows each time, it obliges to keep state of every guess and result of each round
        - We should find a way of only rendering the necessary lines
        - The rendering of rounds should be different from the initial rendering of the board
            - For round rendering, we would only need to render the guessed row and the new input line

-   Create a service for an API
-   On last input, validate that all other inputs are valid
